### COVID-19 Global Analysis and Forecasting
<br>
### Project Overview
<br>
This project provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 trends worldwide, utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights from time-series data. The study includes exploratory data analysis, time-series forecasting, and clustering to identify high-risk countries. The primary goal is to understand the pandemic's impact and predict future trends using R.

Key Features
<br>
ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing & Exploration
<br>
Loaded and cleaned COVID-19 data.<br>
Converted dates to appropriate formats.<br>
Aggregated data for global trend analysis.<br>
Computed Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Recovery Rate.
<br>
ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
<br>
Visualized the global trend of COVID-19 cases using ggplot2.<br>
Modeled the time series of confirmed cases using ARIMA with auto.arima().<br>
Generated a 30-day forecast for COVID-19 confirmed cases.
<br>
ðŸ”¬ Clustering of High-Risk Countries
<br>

Aggregated COVID-19 cases by country.<br>
Performed K-Means clustering to categorize countries based on case severity.<br>
Visualized clusters using a log-scaled scatter plot.
